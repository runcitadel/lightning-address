# Citadel's server for Lightning addresses

This server currently runs on lncitadel.space.
It is a reverse-proxy for Lightning addresses, optimized for [LnMe](https://github.com/bumi/lnme). 
It will not work with other Lightning address servers because it automatically generates parts of the initial response statically to save time.

Feel free to host this server yourself!
